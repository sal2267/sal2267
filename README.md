I’m a motivated undergrad passionate about applying **machine learning** and **computational modeling** to real-world challenges — from visualizing battery degradation to detecting neural signals. I’ve built and trained convolutional neural networks, analyzed SEM datasets, and supported multi-electrode array design in academic research labs.

Currently, I’m:
- A **Break Through Tech AI Fellow** at Cornell Tech (selected from 3,000+ applicants)
- Researching neural interface technologies at **Columbia’s Laboratory for Unconventional Electronics**
- Tutoring physics and math through Barnard’s peer support programs

I’m eager to deepen my skills, collaborate with others, and contribute to impactful work in the fields of **AI for science**, **interpretable ML**, and **research engineering**.

## ✨ Fun Fact

When I’m not debugging or designing experiments, you might find me rehearsing with the Columbia Pops Orchestra 🎻, coaching students in early math literacy 🧮, or decompressing over coffee and a good AI podcast ☕.
